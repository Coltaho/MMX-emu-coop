# emu-coop

This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr/snes9x-coop, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. Currently included are modes Mega Man X (J, Only Rockman X at the moment)\
The files you see here are very likely not compatible with other forks of emu-coop. It is recommended to always exchange the entire coop-folder for every release/fork.\
**WARNING: Modes are PROGRAMS, like a .exe file. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.**

## What is shared?

Everything shared by default:
* All weapons collected
* All capsules collected
* Extra Lives (Increases and Decreases)
* Heart Containers/ Subtank collection

Options:
* Dash Mode - Gives you boots at the start of the intro (you keep them through out)
* Soul-Link (HP Shared) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
* Ammo Share is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

## How to Use

* Open the ROM using the snes9x-coop
* Have both players open the coop.lua using "File -> Lua Scripting -> New Lua Script Window..."
* If asked what mode to use, pick the one you intend to use
* Fill out the connection setting, pick your options and click "OK". - Make sure you do NOT use your SRL Nick. Pick something else.
* Wait for the script to say "Connected to Partner"
* You can now play the game

--NONE of the following applies since there is no saving in MMX outside of passwords. If you crash, sorry :( --
In case something terrible happens and you need to restart/reconnect:
* Close and restart the emulator
* Open the ROM you were using
* Start the coop.lua as described above. This time use different nicks and pick the option "Restarting after a Crash?"
* The script will now take its time to sync both players again. Wait until it says "Syncing is done"
* You can now keep on playing
